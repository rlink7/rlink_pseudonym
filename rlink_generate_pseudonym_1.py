"""Generate pseudonyms to de-identify R-LiNK data.

These pseudonyms will be used to de-identify neuroimaging datasets and
biological samples at the source, in acquisition centres, before they
are sent to the relevant databank of biobank.

The algorithm is brain-dead. This is not reusable code, but it seems good
enough for a one-shot run.
